# Rick it ðŸŽµðŸ•º

a Python-based app that, when launched, displays an image of Rick Astley with a transparent background over your desktop and plays the Rickroll song. You wonâ€™t be able to close it manually , the image stays on screen until the song finishes, then disappears on its own.

##  Requirements

to run the script, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 playsound
```


---

## ðŸ›  How to Build the `.exe` File

Make sure [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) is installed:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then run this command to convert your Python script into a Windows executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "rick.png;." --add-data "rickr.mp3;." rickroll.py
```

- The `.exe` will be located in the `dist/` folder.
- `--noconsole` hides the terminal window.
- `--add-data` embeds the audio and image files into the `.exe`.
